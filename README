1. Introduction
DMXD is a dmx daemon developed to be the pc side server for an spi-dmx converter.
For more information about the spi-dmx converter look on my website: http://www.robojan.nl

Dmxd creates an Art-Net Node service on the network. The node listens to Art-Net messages 
broadcasted to the network.

2. Requirements
To compile dmxd the following libraries must be present on the system
- wiringpi (http://wiringpi.com/)
- libartnet (https://www.openlighting.org/libartnet-main/)

3. Compiling and install
To compile dmxd the following commands must be executed
$ make
$ sudo make install

The make install command copies the binary to /usr/bin and the configuration file to /etc
Also the makefile assumes that systemd is used and copies the service file to /usr/lib/systemd/system
It is possible to change the location of the files in the makefile
To uninstall dmxd run $ sudo make uninstall

4. Configuration
This is the default configuration file:
#
# DMX daemon configuration file
#

########## SPI settings ##########
# The SPI port number. (0 or 1)
SPIPort = 0

# The SPI port speed in kHz. 
SPISpeed = 60

# The user that is used for the dmx communication
SPIUser = root

########## Server settings ##########
# The user that is used for the server communication
ServerUser = http
# Initial state of channels(on, off)
InitialState = on

########## Art-Net settings ##########
# The IP address that Art-Net binds to, Change this to your host ip address
ArtNetIp = 0.0.0.0
# The Long name for the Art-Net node(max 63 characters)
ArtNetLongName = SPI-DMX Art-Net daemon http://www.robojan.nl
# The short name for the Art-Net node(max 17 characters)
ArtNetShortName = SPI-DMX daemon
